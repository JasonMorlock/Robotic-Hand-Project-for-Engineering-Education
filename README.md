In this repository, we provide the following materials:

1. Robotic Hand 3D Models: This folder includes the STL files of the 3D models of the hand we employed in this project. The hand models were adopted from [1].


2. Base Unit 3D Models: This folder includes the STL files of the base unit we employed in this this project. These are Servo Housing Unit, Arduino Housing Attachment, and Spool.


3. Robotic Hand and Base Unit Assembly Drawing: This drawing shows front, top, and right facing views for the assembled base unit and a isometric view of the entire assembly.

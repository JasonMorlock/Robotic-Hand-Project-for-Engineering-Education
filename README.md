# Robotic Hand Project for Engineering Education
This project is intented to be used in a classroom setting for introductory engineers. It includes topics in Arduino coding and circuitry in a simple mechatronic.
Students will assemble the mechanism and circuit. We provide the following supplementary materials

1. Robotic Hand 3D Models: This folder includes the STL files of the 3D models of the hand we employed in this project. The models are taken from: 


2. Base Unit 3D Models: This folder includes the STL files of the base unit we employed in this this project. These are spool, ...
